<b><h5>3D Java Game Engine (Currently Under Development)</h5></b>
================

This is my first attempt at a 3D Java Engine
More updates will follow as my road map for this project is laid out.
Look for more code to be implemented; shaders, texture mappers, custom lighting, and more!

Below are two screenshots demonstrating recent additions to the engine, specifically: texture mapping on models, dynamic lighting, easy OBJ model importing, and more.

Thanks for visiting!
